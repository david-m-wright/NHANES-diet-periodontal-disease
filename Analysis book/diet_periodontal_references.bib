	abstract = {Objective
Pattern analysis has emerged as a tool to depict the role of multiple nutrients/foods in relation to health outcomes. The present study aimed at extracting nutrient patterns with respect to breast cancer (BC) aetiology.


Design
Nutrient patterns were derived with treelet transform (TT) and related to BC risk. TT was applied to twenty-three log-transformed nutrient densities from dietary questionnaires. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 \% confidence intervals computed using Cox proportional hazards models quantified the association between quintiles of nutrient pattern scores and risk of overall BC, and by hormonal receptor and menopausal status. Principal component analysis was applied for comparison.


Setting
The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).


Subjects
Women (n 334 850) from the EPIC study.


Results
The first TT component (TC1) highlighted a pattern rich in nutrients found in animal foods loading on cholesterol, protein, retinol, vitamins B12 and D, while the second TT component (TC2) reflected a diet rich in β-carotene, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamins C and B6, fibre, Fe, Ca, K, Mg, P and folate. While TC1 was not associated with BC risk, TC2 was inversely associated with BC risk overall (HRQ5 v. Q1=0·89, 95 \% CI 0·83, 0·95, P
trend{\textless}0·01) and showed a significantly lower risk in oestrogen receptor-positive (HRQ5 v. Q1=0·89, 95 \% CI 0·81, 0·98, P
trend=0·02) and progesterone receptor-positive tumours (HRQ5 v. Q1=0·87, 95 \% CI 0·77, 0·98, P
trend{\textless}0·01).


Conclusions
TT produces readily interpretable sparse components explaining similar amounts of variation as principal component analysis. Our results suggest that participants with a nutrient pattern high in micronutrients found in vegetables, fruits and cereals had a lower risk of BC.},

	abstract = {Objective: We used epidemiologic data of clinical periodontal status from two population‐based samples in two countries, United States and Germany, to examine 1) the impact of age on the relative contribution of recession and pocketing on the distribution of clinical attachment loss, and 2) whether it is feasible to define age‐dependent thresholds for severe periodontitis.
Methods: The analytical sample was based on persons aged ≥30 and included 10,713 individuals in the United States, participants in NHANES 2009 to 2014, and 3,071 individuals in Pomerania, Germany, participants in the SHIP‐Trend 2008 to 2012. NHANES used a full‐mouth examination protocol to collect data on recession (R), pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) for six sites/tooth on a maximum of 28 teeth; SHIP‐Trend used a half‐mouth examination at four sites/tooth. In both samples, percentile distributions of mean CAL/person were generated for each 5‐year age interval. Age‐dependent thresholds defining the upper quintile of mean CAL were calculated for both samples. The topographic intraoral distribution of CAL and the relative contribution of R and PD on CAL was assessed.
Results: Mean CAL increased linearly with age in both samples and was higher in SHIP‐Trend than NHANES across the age spectrum. In contrast, mean PD was constant across age groups in both populations. R contributed increasingly to CAL with age, especially after 45 to 49 years. Upper quintile mean CAL thresholds in NHANES were {\textless} 3 mm for ages up to 39 years, and under 3.58 mm in all other age groups. Corresponding values in SHIP‐Trend were also {\textless} 3 mm in ages up to 39 years but increased linearly with age up to 7.21 mm for ages ≥75 years.
Conclusions: Despite substantial differences in the overall severity of attachment loss between the two samples, common patterns of CAL and of the relative contribution of R and PD to CAL with increasing age were identified. Although periodontitis severity may vary in different populations, empirical evidence‐driven definitions of CAL thresholds signifying disproportionate severity of periodontitis by age are feasible.},

Sharing many similarities with principal component analysis, the treelet transform can reduce a multidimensional dataset to the projections on a small number of directions or components that account for much of the variation in the original data. However, in contrast to principal component analysis, the treelet transform produces sparse components. This can greatly simplify interpretation. I describe the tt Stata add-on for performing the treelet transform. The addon includes a Mata implementation of the treelet transform algorithm alongside other functionality to aid in the practical application of the treelet transform. I demonstrate an example of a basic exploratory data analysis using the tt add-on.},
